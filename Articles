The Green New Deal is Democratic-Socialist Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s plan to fight climate change. Seven Democratic senators either running for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination or considering it have signed on as co-sponsors to the Green New Deal.

The central goal of the Green New Deal is to achieve “a greenhouse gas neutral society” in 10 years and includes such measures as:

    upgrading or replacing all buildings in the United States to be energy efficient in 10 years
    substituting air travel with high-speed rail in 10 years
    phasing out the use of fossil fuels* entirely in 10 years (*coal, oil, gas used to generate electricity and power our vehicles)

The resolution itself, released by Rep. Ocasio-Cortez (N.Y.) and Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) on February 7, uses a report on global warming released by the United Nations last October on catastrophic climate change, claiming it will occur unless we do something about it in the next 12 years.

In an interview in January, Rep. Ocasio-Cortez said, “Millennials and Gen Z and all these folks that come after us are looking up, and we’re like, ‘The world is going to end in 12 years if we don’t address climate change, and your biggest issue is how are we gonna pay for it?’ ”

Although Ocasio-Cortez’s public announcement about the Green New Deal was widely reported on, some specific details were not reported.

Following concerns over the details of the plan, which Rep. Ocasio-Cortez listed in a fact sheet, the fact sheet was removed from Rep. Ocasio-Cortez’s website, and she and her team claimed the fact sheet had been doctored with false/inaccurate points. They had to backtrack on that claim as the original factsheet is available in numerous locations. (Including here and here.) 

One criticism was of a guarantee of “economic security for all who are unable or ‘unwilling’ to work.”  (See the “Overview” section.) Green New Deal advisor Robert C. Hockett stated that this line was present only in “doctored” versions of the FAQ, but later said he had been “mistaken” [because it really is part of the Green New Deal].

Daniel Turner at The Daily Signal notes:

    The Green New Deal calls for moving to 100 percent renewable or net zero-emission energy sources within 10 years. According to a fact sheet distributed by Ocasio-Cortez’s office, the goal is to “decommission every nuclear plant in 10 years” while not creating any new nuclear plants. (The Green New Deal also opposes hydropower [electricity generated by water].)

    …Despite billions of dollars in federal subsidies [taxpayers’ money] to incentivize the [advancement of wind and solar technologies], fossil fuels and nuclear power remain the foundation of our energy.

Rep. Ocasio-Cortez and Sen. Markey’s introduction of the Green New Deal on Feb. 7 was widely reported on. However, the extreme details were left out in every news report. See a few examples below of how the story was reported:

Amy Klobuchar's 2020 campaign raises $5.2M in seven weeks




Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., raised more than $5 million in the first seven weeks of her bid for the presidency, her campaign announced Monday.

In a press release, Klobuchar's campaign also said it had an end-of-the-quarter total of over $8 million with more than $7 million on hand.

“The Amy For America Campaign has been focused on connecting with voters and grassroots donors across the country, engaging nearly 100,000 new supporters online in the first seven weeks of the campaign," the press release said. “Klobuchar’s average online grassroots contribution was $40,” the statement added, noting her average donor gave less than $100 dollars to the campaign.

Other candidates have begun announcing their first-quarter hauls, some of which were significantly larger than what Klobuchar announced Monday.

Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., said he raised $18 million in the same period, Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., said she raised $12 million, former Texas Democratic Rep. Beto O’Rourke announced a more than $9 million haul, Mayor Pete Buttigieg said he raised $7 million, and Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., raised more than $5 million, according to his campaign.

Klobuchar has roughly 1.7% support, putting her in eighth place among a crowded field of candidates vying for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, according to RealClearPolitics' average of polls.

Deaf Republic,' open ears
by Mark Naida
  April 05, 2019
.................

I wouldn’t say every book on Amazon’s list of best-selling poetry deserves the title. It begins with Seuss, then print and Kindle versions of Rupi Kaur’s Milk and Honey, some Mary Oliver titles, the Shel Silverstein classics, and that weird book of rhymes Lin-Manuel Miranda wrote. But just past Homer’s The Odyssey is a contemporary masterpiece: Ilya Kaminsky’s Deaf Republic.

This book is proof that in 2019 great poetry can enjoy tremendous popularity.

Most books of poetry are collections of disparate poems that have found homes in different poetry journals over time. And usually, once a poet decides those journal and magazine acceptances have reached a critical mass, they compile a collection and leave readers to bumble through it, trying to yank a theme out of many years' worth of different poems.

But Deaf Republic is a complete artifact, similar to a novel written in a mix of prose and verse, which meditates on consistent themes through the experience of a few characters.

Kaminsky, 42, is from Ukraine and his first book, Dancing in Odessa, garnered numerous awards upon its release in 2004. He has joined the ranks of poets such as Joseph Brodsky and Charles Simic who, having mastered English as a second or third language, have put many native poets to shame.

Trump’s Mar-a-Lago Scandal Just Got Bigger

A Chinese woman arrested after breaching security at President’s Donald Trump’s private club in Florida had a signal detector, other electronics, and thousands of dollars stashed in her hotel room, federal prosecutors said during a court hearing in West Palm Beach, Florida on Monday. On March 30, Secret Service agents arrested Yujing Zhang at Mar-a-Lago and, according to an affidavit filed in federal court, found her carrying a thumb drive containing malware, four cell phones, a hard drive, and a laptop. The new disclosure will certainly capture the attention of counterintelligence experts who have expressed concern about her alleged intrusion. But during the hearing, assistant US attorney Rolando Garcia said there is “no allegation that she is involved in any espionage.” Garcia also claimed that Zhang “lies to everyone she encounters,” according to multiple reports. 

Prosecutors said that a search of Zhang’s hotel room revealed a signal detector designed to find and detect hidden cameras, a cell phone, nine USB drives, five SIM cards, several credit cards, and $7,500 in cash. Zhang has been charged with making false statements to federal authorities—that is, allegedly lying to a Secret Service agent about her attempt to gain entry to Mar-a-Lago—and unauthorized entry of a restricted area. Trump was staying at Mar-a-Lago that weekend but reportedly golfing elsewhere at the time of her arrest.

A Federal Government decision to fund couples counselling and mediation for families dealing with domestic violence has been slammed by advocacy groups.

The Government announced a $10 million funding package for Specialist Family Violence Services in the Federal Budget as part of a broader domestic violence initiative.

Organisations that provide family relationship services, including broad-based counselling and dispute resolution, have been invited to apply for a grant under the scheme.

But the Director of the Women's Domestic Violence Court Advocacy Service, Hayley Foster, said it is an ill-informed initiative that could risk more lives.
